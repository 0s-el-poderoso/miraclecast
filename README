= MiracleCast - Wifi-Display/Miracast Implementation =

The MiracleCast project provides software to connect external monitors to your
system via Wifi. It is compatible to the Wifi-Display specification also known
as Miracast. MiracleCast implements the Display-Source as well as Display-Sink
side.

The Display-Source side allows you to connect external displays to your system
and stream local content to the device. A lot of effort is put into making this
as easy as connecting external displays via HDMI.
On the other hand, the Display-Sink side allows you to create wifi-capable
external displays yourself. You can use it on your embedded devices or even on
full desktops to allow other systems to use your device as external display.

== Requirements ==

  The MiracleCast projects requires the following software to be installed:
    - systemd: A system management daemon. It is used for device-management
               (udev), dbus management (sd-bus) and service management.
               Systemd must be compiled with --enable-kdbus, even though kdbus
               isn't used, but only the independent, experimental sd-libraries.
      required: >=systemd-212

    - glib: A utility library. Used by the current DHCP implementation. Will
            be removed once sd-dns gains DHCP-server capabilities.
      required: ~=glib2-2.38 (might work with older releases, untested..)

    - check: Test-suite for C programs. Used for optional tests of the
             MiracleCast code base.
      optional: ~=check-0.9.11 (might work with older releases, untested..)
